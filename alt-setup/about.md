# Alt Setups

These are just alternate versions of `stack.yaml` that
are used by Github Actions to test the code with different
versions of `filepath` and `os-string`. They will be named
`stack-fp-<ver>-os-<ver>`, where `<ver>` is the version of
either `filepath` or `os-string`. To make things easier,
the version string will be simplified a bit; first, periods
will be removed, and the `.100` part will be simplified to
`.1`.
