## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-11

This was originally supposed to be the first actual release,
but I wound up changing some things, but the changelog on
Hackage wouldn't update. So I just decided to bump to version
1.0.1.

### Added

- Added equivalent functions to those in `os-string`.

## Pre-Release - 2025-10-26

### Changed
